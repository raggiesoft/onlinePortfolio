										<h3>About My Work Portfolio</h3>
									</header>
									<p>My all new Portfolio is rebuilt from the ground up using modern HTML5 and CSS3 media
                                    queries so that it looks great no matter what device you are using.  In laymans terms,
                                    instead of redirecting you to <strong>m.example.com</strong>, I simply ask
                                    <strong>"how wide is your screen?"</strong>  This allows my portfolio contents
                                    to be written a single time and simply reformat as needed.</p>
                                    <p>Would you like to see this in action from a desktop computer?  Try it out now
                                    by simply resizing your browser window and watch as the portfolio resizes
                                    on-the-fly as you shrink and expand the window.</p>
