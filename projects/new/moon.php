										<h3>Moon Observation Chart</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The Moon Observation Chart was my first go at using a template for a fully responsive HTML5 design.  It was a requirement for my Astronomy course at Tidewater Community College that we kept a chart of the position of the Moon over the course of a couple of weeks.  In addition, we had to create a final website for my JavaScript class.</p>
                                    <p>Deciding to do both at once, I created this website to chart the moon while using JavaScript to select which image is loaded for each individual day of observation.</p>
