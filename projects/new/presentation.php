                                    <p>As part of my Public Speaking class, my Final Exam was to do a persuasive speech.  My choice was to do a speech on why Random Drug Testing in the Workplace would be a good idea.  Since almost every presentation to date was using Microsoft PowerPoint, I decided to up the antie, and sharpen my programming skills, by writing my own presentation software that would run on the classroom computers.</p>
