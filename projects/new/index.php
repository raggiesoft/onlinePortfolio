									<p>Welcome to my list of newer projects.  This is my showcase of projects that show off the absolute latest in Responsive HTML5 standards.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    &bull; <a href="go/wata/">Williamsburg Area Transit Authority</a><br />
                                    This is my first modern responsive website project, where I built a website for Williamsburg Area Transit Authority.<br />
                                    &bull; <a href="go/moon/">Moon Observation Chart</a><br />
                                    This is my first foray into a fully immersive Responsive HTML5 journey using a template.  The goal of the site was to create an observation chart of the Moon over the course of a couple of weeks.<br />
                                    &bull; <a href="http://portfolio.raggiesoft.com/">This Portfolio</a><br />
                                    This portfolio showcases the absolute latest in my learnings of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.  It includes the latest in HTML5 Responsive standards, so no matter how you view my portfolio, you can see it properly. 
                                    </p>
