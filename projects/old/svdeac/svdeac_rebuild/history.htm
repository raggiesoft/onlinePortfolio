    <h1 align="center">History of the Disability Employment Awareness Committee of the Shenandoah Valley<strong><br />
    </strong></h1>
    <p>In 1945, decades   before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress   passed Resolution 176 designating the first week of each October as   &quot;National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week&quot;. President Harry S.   Truman designated the President's Committee on Employment of People with   Disabilities to carry out this law.</p>
    <p>In 1962, the word   &quot;physically&quot; was removed from the week's name to recognize the   employment needs of all persons with disabilities. </p>
    <p>In 1988, Congress expanded the week to a month and changed its name to <strong>&quot;National Disability Employment Awareness Month&quot;</strong>.</p>
    <p>The President's Committee   on Employment of People with Disabilities known as the Office of   Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) was given responsibility for leading   this nationwide recognition, and contacted agencies in each state with a   request that they encourage activities commemorating this designated   month. In Virginia, the agency was the Virginia Employment Commission   (VEC).</p>
    <p>Locally, activities were   spearheaded by the Department of Rehabilitative Services Regional Office   and the Woodrow Wilson Rehabilitation Center. Shortly thereafter, the   local office of the VEC and the Regional Office of the Department for   the Blind and Vision Impaired began to participate. Out of these   efforts, the Disability Employment Awareness Committee of the Shenandoah Valley (DEACSV) expanded to include many other community agencies,   organizations and businesses for more than 15 years.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Annual   Awardâ€™s Recognition Event, the DEACSV has provided exhibits and   presentations to schools, disability awareness and ADA trainings,   various assistive technology contests for local youth and educational   luncheons with prominent speakers.    <!-- end .content --></p>
