                                     <p>Specta Gardens was my first venture into creating and accessing a MySQL Database, as well as creating a CSS-based Image Map that properly degrades when using an older browser as well as being fully accessible to the visually impaired.  <strong>Note that the mobile version has <i>never</i> worked.  Also, the Retutn to Classwork Profile link no longer works either.</strong></p>
