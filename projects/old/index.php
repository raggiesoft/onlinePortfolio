										<h3>My Older Projects</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Older projects are available for archival purposes, but I do not maintain them anymore.  You can look at how I used to do things.  For website projects, these older projects usually are not using a responsive HTML5 design.</p>
                                     <p>
                                    &bull; <a href="go/oldprofile/">My Original Portfolio</a><br />
                                    My portfolio of work was originally created using older HTML 4.0 technologies, and features a non-responsive layout.<br />
                                    &bull; <a href="go/ccdt/">Cordova County Department of Transportation</a><br />
                                    Cordova County Department of Transportation is my very first PHP-based website.  I was "learning by doing" by creating a fictional public transit agency.  <strong>Please note that the mobile version no longer works properly.</strong><br />
                                    &bull; <a href="go/openttd/">OpenTTD Installer</a><br />
                                    I am the original author of the installer for OpenTTD for Windows.  While the installer changed a lot over the years, some of my code is still in use (an example being when you install a new version on top of an older version).<br />
                                    &bull; <a href="go/specta/">Specta Gardens</a><br />
                                    Specta Gardens was my first venture into creating and accessing a MySQL Database, as well as creating a CSS-based Image Map that properly degrades when using an older browser as well as being fully accessible to the visually impaired.  <strong>Note that the mobile version has <i>never</i> worked.  Also, the Retutn to Classwork Profile link no longer works either.</strong>
